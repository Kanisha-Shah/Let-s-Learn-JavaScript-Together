## **3️⃣ How to Add JavaScript to a Web Page?**
JavaScript can be added in **3 ways**:

1. **Inline JavaScript (Inside HTML)**
   ```html

    ```html
    <script>
        console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
    </script>
    ```
3. **External JavaScript (Using a .js File)**
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```

## 4️⃣ What is NPM (Node Package Manager)?

### 📌 What is NPM?
**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is the **largest software registry in the world** and is used to **install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries and frameworks**. It comes **built-in with Node.js** and is essential for modern JavaScript development.

### 🛠️ Why Do We Need NPM?
✅ **Easily install JavaScript libraries** (React, Express, Lodash, etc.).  
✅ **Manage project dependencies** (track package versions).  
✅ **Run scripts & automation tasks** (build, test, deploy).  
✅ **Use open-source packages** from the NPM registry.


## 5️⃣ Why Do We Need Node.js?
- Before Node.js – JavaScript could only run inside browsers.
- With Node.js – JavaScript can now
```
    ✅ Handle servers   ✅ Read/write files    ✅ Connect to databases
```

### 🚀 Installing NPM & Checking the Version

#### 🔽 Download & Install Node.js
To use **Node.js** and NPM, download and install the latest version:
